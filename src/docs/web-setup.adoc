This guide describes how you can use GR8 CRM Grails plugins to develop a simple web site with content authoring support.

== GR8 CRM

include::gr8crm.adoc[]

Two plugins stand out from the rest by being included in almost all enterprise applications no matter what business they
were developed to support, +crm-contact+ contains features for managing contacts/companies/addresses
and +crm-content+ contains features for content authoring and document storage.
Almost all enterprise applications manages customers and some kind of digital content.

However there is one type of application that manages content but not necessary customers and that is a simple web site.
The +crm-content+ plugin can be used by web content authors to publish HTML pages on a web site.

This guide describes how you can use GR8 CRM Grails plugins to develop a simple web site.
The +crm-content+ plugin makes it possible to add HTML pages in a content repository and make the pages publicly accessible.

The +crm-content+ plugin is "web-front" plugin. Meaning it includes functionality to publish content on a web site.
It *does not* include functionality for content authoring. A companion plugin +crm-content-ui+ adds authoring support
for content creators.

Lets start from scratch and create a Grails application that when deployed to a web server will serve as a simple web site.

== Prerequisites

As of this writing the GR8 CRM plugins are not tested with Grails versions above 2.2.4, so please *make sure you have Grails 2.2.4 installed* and ready before you attempt to follow this guide.
Newer versions of Grails will be tested and adjustments will be done if needed to support newer versions, but because of lack of resources that work has not yet been done.
If you have the knowledge you are welcome to try with newer versions of Grails but I cannot guarantee it will work.

== Create a new Grails application

    $ grails create-app mywebsite
    $ cd mywebsite

In this project we want (web) content management support so we need to add the crm-content-ui plugin in BuildConfig.groovy.
You must also add some other plugins needed at runtime.

- twitter-bootstrap
- less-resources

Your plugin section in +BuildConfig.groovy+ should look like this:

[source,groovy]
.BuildConfig.groovy
----
plugins {
    build ":tomcat:$grailsVersion"
    runtime ":hibernate:$grailsVersion"

    compile ":jquery:1.10.2"
    compile ":resources:1.2.7"
    compile ":twitter-bootstrap:2.3.2"
    compile ":less-resources:1.3.3.2"

    compile ':cache:1.1.1'

    compile ":crm-security-shiro:2.0.0"
    compile ":crm-i18n:2.0.0"
    compile ":crm-content-ui:2.0.0"
}
----

We want our application to be a public web site, therefore we must add a few parameters to +Config.groovy+ to support this.

[source,groovy]
.Config.groovy
----
crm.feature.crmContent.required = true // <1>
crm.security.controllers.public = ['crmFileAccess', 'crmPageNotFound'] // <2>
crm.content.cms.path = '/website/pages/' // <3>
----
<1> Enable the crm-content plugin for all users
<2> Controllers that should be excluded from authentication so they can be accessed by anyone
<3> Look for HTML pages in the +/website/pages+ virtual folder.

== Start the application

Now you should be ready to start the application!

[source,sh]
----
$ grails run-app

| Server running. Browse to http://localhost:8080/mywebsite
----

Point your browser to the application URL and you should see the familiar Grails start page.

image::default-start-page.png[role="thumb",title="Grails default start page"]

The list of installed plugins is long but that's normal. It contains all transitive plugins pulled in by dependency resolution.

This was not very interesting. How do we publish content on the web site?

== Load data

In order to publish content you must login as a valid application user.
To do this we must load the database with some metadata like users and permissions.
We must also create a folder structure to hold our web content.

Add this to +BootStrap.groovy+:

[source,groovy]
.BootStrap.groovy
----
class BootStrap {

    def navigationService
    def crmAccountService
    def crmSecurityService
    def crmContentService

    def init = { servletContext ->

        navigationService.registerItem('main',
            [controller: 'crmFolder', action: 'list', title: 'crmContent.index.label', order: 20]) // <1>
        navigationService.updated()

        def admin = crmSecurityService.createUser([username: "admin", password: "admin",
            email: "firstname.lastname@email.com", name: "Site Admin", enabled: true]) // <2>

        crmSecurityService.addPermissionAlias("permission.all", ["*:*"])

        crmSecurityService.runAs(admin.username) {
            def account = crmAccountService.createAccount([status: "active"], [:]) // <3>
            def tenant = crmSecurityService.createTenant(account, "Website") // <4>
            crmSecurityService.runAs(admin.username, tenant.id) {
                crmSecurityService.addPermissionToUser("permission.all")

                def root = crmContentService.createFolder(null, "website", "Web site content", "", "") // <5>
                def images = crmContentService.createFolder(root, "images", "Web site images", "", "")
                def pages = crmContentService.createFolder(root, "pages", "Web pages", "", "")
            }
        }
    }
----
<1> Add a navigation item for content authoring to the main menu
<2> Create the admin user
<3> Create an account to hold our tenants
<4> Create a tenant were we will store all information
<5> Create a folder structure to hold all our web content

[NOTE]
====

*Multitenancy* refers to a principle in software architecture where a single instance of the software runs on a server,
serving multiple client-organizations (tenants). Multitenancy contrasts with multi-instance architectures where separate
software instances (or hardware systems) operate on behalf of different client organizations.
With a multitenant architecture, a software application is designed to virtually partition its data and configuration,
and each client organization works with a customized virtual application. <<Multitenancy>>

All GR8 CRM plugins are required to support multitenancy. There are no automatic filtering going on behind the scenes by +Hibernate Filters+ or similar.
All plugins must be developed with multitenancy in mind and filter every query on the domain's +tenantId+ property.
====

Now restart the application and browse to http://localhost:8080/mywebsite again.

On the Grails start page click on +grails.plugins.crm.content.CrmFolderController+ in the *Available Controllers* section.
You will now be forced to login using the username and password you specified in +BootStrap.groovy+ (admin/admin).
It's the +crm-security-shiro+ plugin that kicks in and protects controller access using *Apache Shiro*.

image::login-dialog-grails.png[role="thumb",title="Login Dialog"]

When successfully logged in you will see a page where you can search for files and folders.
Click the +Find+ button and you will see a list of folders.

image::folder-list-grails.png[role="thumb",title="List of folders"]

== Twitter Bootstrap design

However there is something wrong with the user interface and design. The user interface cannot be meant to be this ugly?!

No the user interface can be better looking. We have to add some twitter bootstrap configuration to +ApplicationResources.groovy+
and remove the layout that was copied to *grails-app/views/layouts* folder by +grails create-app+.

Edit +grails-app/conf/ApplicationResources.groovy+ and make it look like this:

[source,groovy]
.ApplicationResources.groovy
----
modules = {
    'bootstrap-responsive-less' {
        dependsOn 'bootstrap'
        resource id:'bootstrap-responsive-less', url:[plugin: 'twitter-bootstrap', dir: 'less', file: 'responsive.less'], attrs:[rel: "stylesheet/less", type:'css', order:150], disposition: 'head'
    }
    application {
        dependsOn 'bootstrap-responsive-less'
        resource url:[plugin: 'twitter-bootstrap', dir: 'less', file: 'bootstrap.less'], attrs:[rel: "stylesheet/less", type:'css', order:10], disposition: 'head'
        resource url:'js/application.js'
    }
}
----

Remove the default layout.

    rm grails-app/views/layouts.main.gsp

Now refresh the browser and you should see a design based on Twitter Bootstrap.

image::folder-list-bootstrap.png[role="thumb",title="List of folders with Twitter Bootstrap design"]

== URL mapping for HTML pages

The crm-content plugin supports publishing HTML documents to a web site but this functionality is not enabled by default.
To enable *website mode* we must add one line in +grails-app/conf/UrlMappings.groovy+

[source,groovy]
.UrlMappings.groovy
----
"404"(controller: "crmPageNotFound", action: "index")
----

The above configuration routes 404 (page not found) errors to a special Grails controller that looks up and renders HTML pages.

== Create an HTML page

Now click on the folder *Web pages* to move into this folder, then click the +New HTML file+ button.

image::add-html-file.png[role="thumb",title="New HTML file"]

A *Rich Text Editor* is opened where you can create you web page without the need to know HTML.

Write some meaningful text and save the page as *index.html*.

image::html-editor.png[role="thumb",title="Rich Text Editor"]

Now you are ready to access *your first web page*!

Type the application URL followed by +index.html+ into your browser address bar and your carefully crafted page should appear.

http://localhost:8080/mywebsite/index.html

image::first-page.png[role="thumb",title="Our first page"]

== Web Layout

Where does the header come from? The Grails logo and the horizontal menu?
In a previous step we removed the layout +grails-app/views/layouts.main.gsp+, so where does it pickup the Twitter Bootstrap layout?

The user interface plugin +crm-ui-bootstrap+ contains a layout called +main.gsp+. That's what you see in your browser.
This layout is specifically made to support the _back-office_ user role, like content creators and administrators.
It's not made for public facing web sites. So we must create a new layout for our web content.

Create a file called +grails-app/views/layouts/web.gsp+ and add the following markup:

[source,html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" class="no-js">
<head>
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/>
    <title><g:layoutTitle default="My GR8 Web"/></title>
    <r:require modules="application, crm"/>
    <r:layoutResources/>
    <g:layoutHead/>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <g:layoutBody/>
    </div>
    <r:layoutResources/>
</body>
</html>
----

We must tell the +crm-content+ plugin to use this new layout for web content.
Edit +Config.groovy+ and change +crm.content.cms.layout+ to +web+.

    crm.content.cms.layout = 'web'

We have to restart the application for changes to take effect, but that will destroy our manually crafted web page *index.html*.
To avoid repeated manual work we can add code to +BootStrap.groovy+ to programatically create *index.html* when the application starts.
Add this code *after* the code that creates the folder +pages+ in BootStrap.groovy.

[source,groovy]
.BootStrap.groovy
----
crmContentService.createResource("""
<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</p>
""", "index.html", pages)
----

Now refresh the browser and you should see the contents of index.html without any layout around it.

image::empty-layout.png[role="thumb",title="Blank Layout"]

There is one annoying problem left. If you access the application URL http://localhost:8080/mywebsite (without index.html) you'll get the default Grails welcome page.
We want *index.html* to be displayed when users navigate to the default URL. This can be done by changing a line in +grails-app/conf/UrlMappings.groovy+.
The "/" URI is by default mapped to the *index* view. This will display +grails-app/views/index.gsp+ in the browser.
If we add a *.html* extension to the view it will show our *index.html* page instead.

   "/"(view:"/index.html")

Point your browser to http://localhost:8080/mywebsite and it should display our *index.html* page.
The default Grails *index.gsp* will not be accessible anymore because it's "hidden" by the URL mapping.
If you want a clean project you can delete +grails-app/views/index.gsp+ now.

== Custom stylesheet

Up until now our layout has been using the default stylesheets from the +twitter-bootstrap+ Grails plugin, but we want to put
a little personal style to our website by changing some colors and styles. To do this we must copy the default styles and modify them.

Create a folder under your application's web-app folder called +less+. Then locate the +twitter-bootstrap+ plugin that your application uses.
If you use IntelliJ IDEA you can access it in the Project Explorer under the Plugins/twitter-bootstrap-2.3.2 folder.
If you're not using IntelliJ you can find the plugins in $HOME/.grails/.../plugins.
Another option is to copy the file from it's source https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v2.3.2/less/variables.less


Copy the file +variables.less+ from the twitter-bootstrap distribution and put it in the less folder under your application's +web-app+ folder.
Then create an empty file under your application's +web-app/less+ folder called +application.less+ with this content:

[source,css]
.application.less
----
@import "responsive.less";

// Add your CSS changes and additions here...
h1 {
  color: @green;
}
----

You should now have two files in your application's web-app/less folder:

    application.less
    variables.less

To make the application use our custom styles we must edit +grails-app/conf/ApplicationResources.groovy+ and change the
+application+ module. We must remove the +plugin+ key and change +file+ value from +bootstrap.less+ to +application.less+.

[source,groovy]
.ApplicationResources.groovy
----
application {
    dependsOn 'bootstrap-responsive-less'
    resource url:[dir: 'less', file: 'application.less'], attrs:[rel: "stylesheet/less", type:'css', order:10], disposition: 'head'
    resource url:'js/application.js'
}
----

Restart the application and refresh the start page, the header text (h1) should now be green.

image::custom-style.png[role="thumb",title="Custom Stylesheet"]

You can add your custom styles and override existing styles in +application.less+.
You can refer to <<LESS>> variables located in +variables.less+ like +@blue+, +@linkColor+ and +@navbarHeight+.

== Import HTML pages from files

The *index.html* file was added programatically in BootStrap.groovy. That's easy for testing and to get a page up and running quickly.
But adding HTML pages as Groovy code is not the smartest thing to do. There is another option built into the +crm-content+ plugin.
We can have it import HTML files (or any other content) from the file system when the application starts.

Edit BootStrap.groovy and add the +crmContentImportService+ bean.

[source,groovy]
.BootStrap.groovy
----
class BootStrap {
    ...
    def crmContentImportService
}
----

Then remove the statement *crmContentService.createResource(...)* and replace it with this line:

    crmContentImportService.importFiles("templates/crm", "admin")

This will import all files under +src/templates/crm+ as web resources.
Under this folder your can put HTML pages, images, PDF:s or any other file type you want to use on your web site.

Create two new folders under +src/templates/crm/website+:

    images
    pages

Then put a file called +index.html+ in the +.../website/pages+ folder with the same content as before:

[source,html]
.index.html
----
<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</p>
----

This file will now be imported when the application starts. The end result is exactly the same as with the createResource(...)
code that we had before in BootStrap.groovy.

You can add all your HTML pages in +pages+ and images in +images+. You refer to images with the following path:

    <img src="/mywebsite/r/1/website/images/imagename.png/>

The +r+ prefix is for *resources* and number +1+ is the *ID* of our tenant where we store all data.

'''

This concludes our first part of this guide. We now have a Grails application that can serve as a public facing web site.
It has built-in content editing features, including image uploads. You can add HTML pages and images in src/templates/crm/website
that will be imported when the application starts. Or you can configure a persistent database in DataSource.groovy and start
creating pages manually in the rich text editor.

// In the link:blog-setup.html[next part] we will add the +crm-blog+ plugin to our application and start adding blog posts to our web site.
