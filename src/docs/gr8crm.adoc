*GR8 CRM* "Great Customer Relationship Management" is the name of a suite of plugins that help developers write customer relationship
oriented applications using the open source web application framework *Grails* by *Pivotal Inc.*

The GR8 CRM "ecosystem" currently contains over 40 open source plugins for use with Grails. Most of them were developed as part of some kind of
enterprise application managing customers, projects, tasks, documents, etc.

Each plugin contains functionality that supports a specific problem domain. For example the `crm-task` plugin contains functionality
for scheduling tasks to be performed by people typically displayed in to-do lists or calendars.
The `crm-task` plugin focuses on that specific domain and does not contain features for managing customers, projects or any other non-task related features.

Each GR8 CRM plugin was developed with this separation-of-concern philosophy. This makes it easy to develop a Grails application
with just the functionality that is needed by assembling a set of GR8 CRM plugins covering they required features. No more, no less.
The time is takes to develop an application can be heavily reduced by the use of pre-defined standard plugins.
